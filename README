			dracinsert

DRAC is a daemon that dynamically updates a relay authorization map for sendmail. 
For more info, see the homepage:  http://mail.cc.umanitoba.ca/drac/

dracinsert is a command line utility to add ip addrs to the DRAC daemon.

usage:  dracinsert ([-h] | [-s drac_server] xx.xx.xx.xx [...])


NEED / BACKGROUND
-----------------

I wrote this utility a few years ago to deal with the issue of relaying email for
clients on dynamic addrs around the internet (nationwide dialup providers in this
case).  It's a little better than POP-before-SMTP, as implemented it was "dialup-
before-smtp".  I added a FreeRadius hook to call dracinsert whenever a user logged
in, and the mail server was configured to use DRAC to permit relaying.

I'll note, this was a poor solution to this issue, so don't do it.  Use SMTP
authentication instead.  But that said, dracinsert may be useful for other
scenarios, too.

FreeRadius
----------

This was on a freeradius 1.1.3 setup, exceprts from radiusd.conf:

modules {
	# .. snip ..
	exec dracinsert {
		wait = yes
		output = none
		program = "/usr/local/sbin/dracinsert %{Framed-IP-Address}"
	}
	# .. snip ..
}

instantiate {
	# .. snip ..
	dracinsert
}

accounting {
	dracinsert
	# .. snip ..
}
